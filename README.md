## SETUP

Run `npm install` to download necessary packages.
To run the service, enter `node app.js`.

### CORS Middleware

If you are making requests from the browser, then be sure to specify your client's
address within the `corsOptions` object in `app.js`.

## COMMUNICATION CONTRACT

Since this Micro service only includes POST requests, each call includes both
requests data and receives it.

1. Create a virtual environment for your code and ensure that requests module
   is installed and imported in your file.

### HOW TO REQUEST DATA:

The processes of requesting data is made using the requests module, using
a known url (endpoint) and body of request

#### Example request in Python:

```python
import requests


url = 'http://localhost:3000/upload-csv'
file_path = "sample_data.csv"

with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
    # The file is sent in the 'file' field as a multipart form-data
    files = {'file': file}

    # Send a POST request to the API Gateway with the file
    response = requests.post(url, files=files)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("JSON Response:", response.json())
    else:
        print("Error:", response.status_code, response
```

### HOW TO RECEIVE DATA:

this is made by inspecting the response of the POST request. Once the request
is made the response can be retrieved as follows.

Example:

if response.status_code == 200:
print("JSON Response:", response.json()) # Print the JSON response from the server
else:
print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
